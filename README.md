Project Description:
During my internship at CodTech IT Private Limited, I worked on a CoinGecko Public API project, a full-stack web application designed to display live cryptocurrency data. The project enables users to view real-time prices, market capitalization, and other details of multiple cryptocurrencies, with instant updates from the CoinGecko API.

The frontend was developed using React.js, providing a responsive and interactive interface for viewing live coin data. The backend used Node.js with Express to handle API requests and serve data efficiently. MongoDB was used for persistent storage, allowing users to track coin-related data across sessions.

The application emphasizes real-time data fetching, API integration, and full-stack development practices. Users can monitor live cryptocurrency updates in an easy-to-use interface while the backend handles API communication and data management.

This internship helped me enhance my skills in React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, and API integration, while gaining hands-on experience in developing interactive, data-driven full-stack applications. The project also demonstrates the ability to work under guidance, follow best coding practices, and deliver a functional solution within the one-month internship duration.
